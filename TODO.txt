- Figure out why pixels tend to go black/white in the center of reflections
- Figure out a correct lighting/reflection model
- Add some form of texture mapping
- Add tranparency and refraction
- Remove quad in favor of plane
- Add triangle primitive
- Separate vertex and polygon definitions
- Separate material and object definitions
- Add support for colored lights
- Add some degree of interactivity to the program (moving spheres/lights)
- Make the scene be read in from a file as opposed to being hardcoded
- Make everyting totally threadsafe? (It seems that by adding locks to this
  program, performance noticeably degrades. The extra accuracy from doing this
  seems to be negligible)
- Add OpenCL acceleration?
