- Figure out why pixels tend to go black/white in the center of reflections
- Figure out a correct lighting/reflection model
- Add new primitives (cubes, rectangles, etc)
- Add some form of texture mapping
- Add tranparency and refraction
- Make quad primitive more efficient and more correct (It currently is modelled as just a rectangle (not general quad)
- Separate vertex and polygon definitions
- Fix shadows appearing on the wrong side of quads
- Add support for triangle meshes
- Add support for colored lights
- Add some degree of interactivity to the program (moving spheres/lights)
- Make the scene be read in from a file as opposed to being hardcoded
- Make everyting totally threadsafe? (It seems that by adding locks to this
  program, performance noticeably degrades. The extra accuracy from doing this
  seems to be negligible)
